**SMART IRRIGARION SYSTEM**


The world is suffering from water crises and most of our pure water is given to agriculture.
Farmers use water very roughly and a large amount of water is being wasted in this process. For
the solution of this, I was thinking to introduce a smart irrigation system to Pakistan which may
lessen the use in agriculture and water will be used smartly. Smart irrigation consists of a
moisture sensor, Arduino, and water motor pump. We use Arduino analog pins for controlling
the motor and using digital pins as input for the moisture. the sensor, when moisture sensor gives
a signal to Arduino motor, turns on and provides water to field until soil. moisture goes to the
desired value. It is also used in lawns. In houses, no one gives attention to flowers in lawn trees
and grass by using this system lawns will remain wet. One moisture sensor can take reading up
to 600m. it is a very cost-effective and maintenance-free device
